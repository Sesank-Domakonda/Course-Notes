What is Docker?
Docker is a container technology: A tool for creating and managing containers.

What is a container? 
container - a standardized unit of software.
Container: Package of code + dependencies to run that code( eg: NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime).

What is the advantage?
The same container always gives the exact same behavior. No matter where or by whom it might be executed.

ex: a picnic basket. so here the basket contains

VM vs Docker
-------------
=>VM has an OS on another OS (refer slides for the pic)

Every VM is like a standalone machine. It wastes a lot of compute, storage etc. on the machine.

=>So VM has both pros and contains

pros                                                                          Con
=>Seperated environments                                                      => Redundant duplication, waste of spacce.
=>Environment specific configurations are possible                            => Performace can be slow, boot times can be long
=>Environment configurations can be shared and reproduced reliably            => Reproducing on another computing server is possible but tricky.



Docker architecture
---------------------

Container     Container         Container
App A         App B             App C
Libs, Deps,   Libs, Deps,       Libs, Deps,
Tools         Tools             Tools
-----------------------------------------------
        Docker Engine
----------------------------------------------
  Built-in container support
-------------------------------------------------
           OS

=> Based on the docker engine we can spin the containers. 
=>The container contains a light weight version of OS.

=>We can build a container into something called as image and share the image with others.
