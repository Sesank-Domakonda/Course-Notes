We have to create the cluster.
Kubernets helps with managing the PODS.
=> It is responsible for managing the deployed application such that the containers are properly running.
=> It will not take care of the infrastructure.

=> Create the cluster and the Node, Setup API server ,kubelet and other kuberntes services/software on nodes.

   What Kubernets will do?                           What you need to do / setup 
 
1) Create you objects(Pods) and manage them          Create cluster and the node instances( worker + Master nodes)

2) Monitor Pods and recreate them, scale pods        Setup API Server, kubelet and other kubernets services/ software on Nodes

3) Kubernets utilizes the provided cloud resources   Create other (cloud) provider resources that might be needed (Load balance, Filesystems) 
to apply your configuration/goals




kubectl -- A tool for sending instrcution to the cluster (eg a new deployment). {President}
Master node {general makes sure the instructions are passed on}
