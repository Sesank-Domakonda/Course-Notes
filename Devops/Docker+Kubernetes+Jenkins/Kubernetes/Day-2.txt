Kubernets Cluster Setup
-----------------------
Kubernets Cluster can be setup in Many ways

* Self Managed K8S Cluster: We can take a linux machine and install all the required softwares in it.
  ------------------------
=> Mini Kube (Single node cluster) : Not used in real time projects.
=> Kubedium (Multi node cluster) : Simialar as the architecture we have seen in the diagram having multiple nodes.

* Managed K8S Cluster : 
  -------------------
=> AWS EKS
=> Azure AKS
=> GCP GKE
=> IBM IKE



Kuber config file: Contains the cluster information about EKS Cluster.  kubectl sends the request to the control plane.


In the AWS we will create  
=> a linux machine called EKS Client VM. We will install several softwares 
=> (AWS CLI) in it to create and communicate with the cluster. We will manage the permission to create the cluster with the IAM. Using CLI we will create a cluster( Control plane and worker nodes).
=> To communicate with the cluster we will install kubectl cli. In order for kubectl to know where the cluster is we will setup the kubeconfig file in the client machine.

Using the client machine we will create a cluster then we will send request to the control plane and then control plane will request the worker nodes.
