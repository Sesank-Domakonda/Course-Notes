Docker - Docker is a containerization platform. It is used to deploy the applications as containers.

Docker swarm - It is an Orchestration platform. It is used to manage docker containers. 
Orchestration means managing the processes.`
 -> Managing refers to creating, updating, scaleup, scaledown, remove containers.
Docker swarm is embedded in Docker engine (no explicit installation is required.)
 Note: In market we have docker swarm, kubernetes, openshift as Orchestration platform.
Say we have a container runnign on the Host OS and suddenly there are many customers who are accessing the container. 
So when the load is increased on the application it may crash so we have to run the application on several containers instead of one container.


Using the Docker swarm we can easily scale up adn scale down te container.

Working
--------
Instead of running teh application in a single containers we are going to setup cluster. 
Cluster - > group od servers.

Docker swarm follows the Cluster Architecture to manage the docker containers. It has 
1) Master Nodes - It will manage the worker nodes and it will assign task to worker nodes.
2) Worker Nodes - Will perform the tasks based on the master node instructions.



                                    Worker 1

Master Node                         Worker 2

                                    Worker 3

If we want to deploy the containers directly we handover the responsibility to Docker swarm.
