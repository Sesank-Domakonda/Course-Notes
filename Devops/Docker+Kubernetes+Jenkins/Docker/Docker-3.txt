Stateful vs Stateless containers
--------------------------------

Stateless container: Data will be deleted after the container got deleted.
Statefull container: Data will be maintained permenently.

Docker containers are stateless by default.

So we use docker volumes

Docker volumes
---------------
=> Used to persist data generated by docker container.
we have 3 types of volumes
*Anonymous
*Named volumes
*Bind mounts

*docker volume ls - check all the local volumes.
*docker volume create <name> - create a volume.


Using bind mounts, the container's storage is mapped to a directory on the host machine. Even if the container is recreated, it will point to the same storage without data loss.
