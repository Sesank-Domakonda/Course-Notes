Git Diff
---------
*git diff
=>This is used to view changes between staging area and the working directory.
=>It is used alongside with git status/git log.


Explanation to the output of diff
==================================
->It starts with the file comparison
->Metadata of the files.
->->Here if we change thousands of line then the command then displays the changes for each chunk.

*git diff HEAD /git diff HEAD [file_name]
--This will compare the difference between the working directory and the last commit.(both staged and unstaged)
--We can narrow down the comparison a specific file when we use the git diff --HEAD style/main.css.
this will now give the difference between the files now.

*git diff --staged
it gives the difference between the staging area and the recent commit.

*git diff branch1 branch2
--it compares the difference between two branches for the recentmost commit.

*git diff commit1 commit2
- it compares the difference between two commits.


Git Stashing
-------------

=>Git provides an easy way to stash the uncommitted changes(staged/unstaged) so we can return to them later, without making unnecessary commits.

*git stash/ git stash save - helps to save changes that are not yet ready to commit.
*git stash pop - removes the most recently stashed change in your stash and reapply them to the working copy.

activity: create a new git rep
		
master								alternate
file1.txt							file2.txt
this is the first file.				this is file2.txt

now switch branch to alternate and then create a fiel2.txt and put the above text in it.

Now stash the commit with git stash save and do two things

on alternate branch do git stash pop
on master repeat the above activity and then use git stash pop.

*git stash apply - this is same as pop but the thing is that it doesn't pop the stash but will remain there and can be applied to multiple areas.


Multiple Stashes
-------------------
we can have multiple stashes in GIT by repeatedly usign the git stash save/git stash.

*git stash list - gives the list of stashes.
*git stash apply <Stash_id> - this will give a particular stash.
