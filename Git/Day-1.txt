Version Control
----------------
-Software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.
-Allow users to revisit early versions, compare changes between version, undo them.

Git vs Github
-------------
Git- is the vcs that runs locally on machine.
Github - It is a service that hosts Git repos in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.

Why Gitbash?
-Bash is a cli interface that is widely used by devs.
-It is default shell for linux and mac. Git was designed to run on a Unix-based interface.

- Windows comes with a different default command line interface called Command promt that is not unix based.

- But gitbash is a tool that will gave a bash experience on a windows machine. 

Configuring Git
---------------

=>To configure the name that Git will associate with your work we use 

*git config --global user.name "<user-name>"
*git config --global user.name - git pushves the usernmae configured
*git config --global user.email 


Git repo
---------
=>A git repo is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.
=> Anytime we want ot use Git with a project we need to create a repo.

*git status - gives info on the current status of repository and its contents.
*git init - it initiates a new git repository

when we initialise a new repo with git init then we will get a hidden file with .git extension.

*git add . - adds the files to the staging area.
*git commit - git commit command is used to commit changes from staging area.
*git log - it displays the commit history of repo and saves details like 
author, names, dates etc.

*git commit --amend - suppose we forgot to include some file in the commit then we can add this file to commit with this command.

git commit -m "message"
git add forgotten file

git commit --amend

*git commit -am "message" - this will directly commit all the files without the need of staging them.

Ignoring some files
-------------------
=>we can ignore some files without git tracking.
=>we can do that with .gitignore.

we can ignore files like 
=> *.log -- it ignores all the log files
