Branches
------------
=>Branches are alternative developement zones for a project
=>They enable us to work on multiple ideas in parallel.

Head
------
=>Head id s pointer which refers to the current location in the repository.
=>It points to a particular branch reference.

*git branch - lists all the branch in the repo
*git branch <branch-name> - creates a new branch
*git switch <branch-name> - switches to a new branch
  git switch -c <branch_name> - this will not only create a new branch it will also switch to it.

*git checkout - this will also switch branches and much more like

Note: say we have a condition that on 

branch-1      branch-1                 branch-2
one.txt       one.branch				one.branch
 * one			*one
 * two			*two
 *three
				
Alright, here's the gist: when you add changes to one.txt in branch-1 and then switch to another branch where one.txt exists but with no content, Git gets cranky. It doesn't want to overwrite your changes, 
so it'll ask you to either stash those changes, add them to the staging area, or commit them.

*git branch -d <branch_name> - this is used to delete the specific branch.
*git branch -m <branch_name> - it is used to rename the branch.
*git branch -v --> it gives out the the recent most commit with the message from each branch



Merging Branches
-------------------
It takes changes from one branch and combines into another.

=>We merge branches but not specific commits.
*Go to the branch where you want the merge to take place (git switch main)
*run git merge giving_branch

Fast forward merge

So in the repo we can see there are some branches
*oldies
*2000s
*master
*empty playlist
*georges

so as seen the oldies branch is very ahead in the commits relative to master.
After running the command 
git switch master
git merge oldies

we can see that the master has fast forwaded.
