Cloning
========
->We have created our own repos from scratch.
->We wanted to get a local copy of an existing repository instead.

*git clone <url>
-when we retrieve this it will clone all the files associated with the repository.
-In addition git initializes a new repo on the machine giving access to the fill git history of the clones project.

SSH Keys: 
-You need to be authenticated on Github to do certain operations like pushing code from local machine.
-Your terminal will prompt you every single time for your Github email and password unless you generate and configure an SSH key!.





GIT remote
----------
=> Before we can push anything up to github, we need to tell Git about our rmeote repo on Github.
=> We need to setup a "destination" to push up to.

=>In GIT we refer to these "Destinations" as remotes.
=>Each remotes is simply a URL where a hosted repository lives.

Viewing Remotes
---------------
*git remotes -v - gives the list of remotes setup. (-v is just a verbose)

A remote is two things
*URL
*label

*git remote add <name> <URL> - here the Name is origin and the URL is the link to git repo.

origin - is a conventional Git remote name but is not at all special.


Git pushing
-------------
* git push <remote> <branch>
 

What does git oush -u origin main mean by?
-u stands for upstream.
It referes to the main remote repo that a local repo is cloned or connected to.

Usually we use the git push -u origin main for the first time.
later we just use git push.


Remote tracking Branches
========================
=> When we clone a repo we will have twoo types of references.
*master branch reference
*remote tracking branch reference.

master branch reference: This points to the latest commit and then updates whenever new commit is made.
remote tracking branch reference: This is the state of the master branch on the remote. We can't move this ourself. Its like a bookmark pointing to the last known commit.
ca
*git branch -r - this commands give the remote tracking branches
*git checkout origin/main - using this we can switch to a specific commit/branch from the remote repository.



=>By default we will we will have our local "main" branch reference the "origin/main" of the remote repo.


Very imp Note: So whenever we clone a repo into out local it is important to note that we do not get all the branches. To have a look at another branches we just need to switch to the other branches
which are in the remote.
