
Creating Users and Groups: (Click on hamburger -> Click on Domains -> Select users on the keft section)
Creating groups: (click on identity -> select a particular domain you want to create groups in domain)


Difference between domains and groups
--------------------------------------
    Domains                                              Groups

containers for managing users,roles                    collection of users that share common access needs 
and security settings. They help to                    permissions.
organize and isolate resources and policies

Just like AWS users can be created in OCi wothout assigning roles.

OCI application roles
---------------------

https://drive.google.com/file/d/16LZyYe-xHsHxTVT5wqOkfW9hzFyuZzyO/view?usp=drive_link

=> We have various roles in OIC such as 
*Service administrator
*Service Developer - A user with this role can develop the artifacts like integration, processes etc.


Granting Role to a user: Go to domain where the user is created(Domain) -> Click on oracle cloud services. Search for the instance you want to add role to.

When we click on the pracle cloud services we will see all the cloud services available (also the instance we have created).
->We can see the roles when we click on the instance -> click on application roles to the left.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/19aLT2j8Ax73g557vYUYU2YdNLTQXUsPj/view?usp=drive_link

So when we click on the instance -> click on the application roles to the left -> we will be able to assign roles to users like service dev, service admin.


OIC Integration Terminologies
-----------------------------

=>XML- extensible markup language - Used for data Interchange between different systems, especially in web services and APIs.
=>Its called markup language because we make use of marks(tags).

->It is used to represent complex documents with a structured format.

ex: 
<xml version = "1.0" encoding= "UTF-8"?>     Prolog - gives the version of XML version and the encoding used.
<book>                                       root element
<title>Sample Book</title>               
<author>John Doe</author>
<price>25.0</price>
</book>


somethimes to represent elements which does not have value/child elemets we can represent it with as <sample/>

refer the XML notes.

XML name spaces
===============

=> Namespaces in XML are used to distinguish between elements that may have the same name but belong to different contexts.
=> the namespace is declared using the xmlns attribute

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRqpyYQWdf8fF1-2vXB5HQegliGL3-dI/view?usp=drive_link

=> Elements and attributes can then use this prefix to indicate that they belong to the specified namespace.

Namespaces in XML are used ti

XSD(XML Schema Definition)
============================
=>XSD will define the structure and constraints of XML data, defining the elements, data types and relationships.
=>It provides a blueprint for validating the structure and content of XML documents.

ex: for example if we want to define say the age of person to be numeric and above 18. we can do this with the XSD.

XPath
======

=> Xpath stands for XML Path language.
=> Xpath used "path like" syntac to identity and navigate nodes in an XML document.

Webservice   - When we talk about a web service, weâ€™re referring to the whole setup that enables the client to send a request and the server to respond over the internet. 
------------
=>Its a way for application to talk to each other and exchange the data over the internet.
=>The webservice is an interface where it takes request from the client, process it and sends it back to the client.

ex: restaurent
when we place an order we become client. 
waiter becomes the webservice where we send a request asking to perform some action.
webservice processes the request and sends back to the response.

WSDL (Webservice Description language)
----------------------------------------
=>Its an XML based language which defines the interface and operations offered by web service.
Purpose: Describes how to access a webservice and its functionalities.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GLaqRDYLfs0lIl1uM00VJfU80Go7nJIK/view?usp=drive_link


ex: String sayHello(String firstName, String lastName){

     String returnMessage = "Hello, "+firstName +" "+ lastName;
     return returnMessage;
}

The above code has function and arguemnts. The same way we have operations and payloads.s

Operation Name: sayHello
Input part1: firstName
Input part2 : lastName

Output part: return message.



Why WSDL?
-----------

say we have a program in Java and we have another application in .NET. But this java application cannot be invoked by the .Net.
=>So to define the webservice the WSDL has been introduced. So after this the application is made generic which can be invoked by any other application.

WSDL types:
=>Abstract WSDL 
=>Concrete WSDL

Types of Webservices
----------------------
1)Synchronous                      ex: inserting card into ATM
2)Asynchronous request/callback    ex: whatsapp forward message is acknowledged with ouble tick.
3)Asynchronous request only
