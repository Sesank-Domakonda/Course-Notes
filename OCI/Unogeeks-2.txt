Web Services
------------
=> web services are services offered over web.
=>Web services enables communication among various applications by using open standards such as XML, WSDL and SOAP.
=>Popular types of webservices are SOAP, REST.

Web Services have two types of uses:
1)Reusable application-components: currency conversion, weather reports, or even language translation as services.
2)Connect existing software: With web services you can exchange data between different applications and differnet platforms.


SOAP Web Services: (Simple Object Access Protocol)
==================================================

=> SOAP web service definition is captured in WSDL. It uses XML format for communication.

SOAP message is an ordinary XML document containing the following elements:
1) Envelope element - identifies XML document as a SOAP message
2) Header element - contains header information
3) Body element contains call and response information
4) Fault element containing errors and status information.

Service WSDL URL: https://servername/fscmService/ErpIntegrationService?WSDL

servername - replaced with fusion cloud instance
fscm - finance and supply chain modules


operations
----------

In a SOAP service would contain operation -> these operations are the logical units 
so when we invoke a SOAP service we are not invoking the whole service but a specific operation.

=>Operations are  the actions performed by the API. Each operation corresponds to a specific task or function that API can perform.

Payload
--------
=> Payload refers to the data carried inside a request or respose message.
Request payload - input data
Response payload - output data.

Envelope element - It converts XML to SOAP message.
In the header section we pass the authentication tokens.

when we pass the WSDL URL to the Soap UI how come all the operations are seen?
In the SOAP UI we passed the URL as an input which gave it all the operations.

Data Types(XSD) -> Messages -> Porttype -> for ever operation

In a WSDL file we have custom data types defined in XSD.
XSD - XML Schema Document.
whatever custom data types we need for that webservice, we would define them in XSD.
These custom data types(request and response) are used to define messages.
These messages are attached to operations under a port type element.

WSDL (tmpb)
----
Web service definition language used to describe web services. It specifies the location of the service, the methods of the service, using these major elements.
<types> - define the XML schema data types used by the web service.
<message> - define the data elements for each operation.
<port type> - describes the opertions that can be performed and the messages involved.
<binding> - defines the Protocol and data format for each port type.


REST
----

In the REST api we have
*CREATE - create a resource
*POST  - create a new resource
*DELETE - remove a resource
*GET   - retrieve a resource/ list of resources
*PATCH (PUT) -  Update a resource.

In the rest API we use query parameter to put a filter on teh search results.
Difference between template and query parameter

the template parameter are placeholders that get replced with specific values. They are usually the Primary keys of the data.
ex: 
URL: /users/{userId}
if we want a certain user we can do /users/123 - indicates we are looking for user 123
