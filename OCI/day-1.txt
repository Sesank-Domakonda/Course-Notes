=>Realm
--------
=>It is a logical collection of regions and are isolated from each other.
=>Your tenancy exists in one realm and can access the regions in that realm.

=>You cannot access regions that are not in your realm.

=>OCI has multiple realms including comercial, government and dedicated realms.



OCI Fundamental Blocks

We can subscribe to more than one region why is that?
Because of the Availability domain.

Availability domains: These are the physical data centers in a region.

->specific services in specifc regions: Since all the services are not available in all the regions. We subscribe to more than one region.
->disaster recovery: when a data center crashes then having the data backup on the other region will help.
->Compliance: Some regulations require data to be stored in specific locations.


Fault domain: 
-------------
- They are seperate areas within a data center.
- if something goes wrong with one area (like power failure or hardware issue) the problem won't affect the other areas.

OCID - oracle identifier
ocid1.<Resource_Type>.<Realm>.[<Region>.<Future_Use>].<Unique_Id>
ocid: Commercial Realm


Domain: (click on hamburger -> go to Identity and Security -> find the domain)
------
=> It is a container for users and groups within in cloud.
ex: if we want to add a set of users/group with common functionality like testing/dev we can add all these users to a domain.


Compartments: (Click on hamburger -> click on the Identity and Security -> click on the se)
--------------
-> Its a logical container used to organize and manage cloud resources within a cloud account.

Tenancy:
---------
-> Its a way of organizing cloud resources where customers either have their own seperate space (single tenancy) or share resources with others (multi tenancy).
-> Its overall arrangement of how resources are allocated and managed for different users or organization.

check tenancy vs compartments

IAM services
------------
Authentication - Veifying a user on who the user says the they claim to be.
Authorization - Permission a user has to navigate around.

Creating an Instance (Click on hamburger -> Developer settings ->Under application integration-> click on Integration )
====================

=>We can also create an instance by going into the Compute and then select the region and availability domain.

Note: Difference between integration instance vs compute instance
Integration Instance: Designed to run integration flows, which automate and process data b/w applications/

Compute Instance: It is a VM that provides the raw computing power to run applications, host websites etc.
