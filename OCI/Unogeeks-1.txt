Why OIC?
=> Usually client has to use on premises some software say Oracle . The client has to buy the Servers, licence and the DB.
=> Also setup a team to Administrate the above.
so this involves huge investment costs.

So this is solved with the cloud.

If we take a typical client. They might be using hybrid IT landscape
ex:
ADP for payrolls.
Salesforce for CRM.
Oracle ERP for finance.

Challenges in Integration?
1)How to integrate Oracle applications? (ex: orcle hcm to erp)
2)Integrating non oracle to oracle appliations.
3)Legacy style Integration is too complex.
4)Data couldn't be moved easily from cloud to on-premises and viceversa.
5)Business process automation


on premises mean by computing environment where the software and hardware are located within the physical confines of organization.
like having servers, storage and other infrastructure.


=>We use different instances for different purposes like.
*Dev
*Prod

If we are supposed to migrate integrations from one environment to another we 
*Export one after another - download the integration -> this will download all the underlying components used like connections,lookups used.
then use import option to upload the integration.

packages
========
=> Maintain the integrations in bulk.

say we have 70 integrations related to ERP cloud
            20 related to HCM cloud
            10 related to Sales cloud.


=>We can add the integration to a package while creating them.
ex: If the integration is related to sales then add it to the Sales package.

=> Go to packages-> click on the 3 dots to the right -> select export -> all the integration with all the libraries,connections etc will be downloaded.


Creating an Integration
========================
When we click on the integration we can create choose among the 3 types
*Application
*Schedule
*Event

Application
--------------
=>When we create an integration as an appdriven a URL will be generated and that will trigger the application.
=> So another application should trigger this application.

ex: Scenario: user has been created in saleforce the same user must be added to oracle ERP.
so here the salesforce(another application) is triggering the integration.

Schedule
----------
=> Integration which gets triggered on a schedule basis.
=> we use use schdule integrations for bulk processing.


Event 
------
=> In OIC we can define an event(structure for the details we want to capture).
=> We will be building an integration.


Connections
------------
=>Help to establish connectivity from oracle instance with other applications.
we pick an adapter
