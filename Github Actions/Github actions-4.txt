Environment Variables and Secrets
---------------------------------
=>Environment variables are dynamic values that computer process to configure applications.
=>It is used to store info like API keys/ DB passwords securely outside the code.

for ex: password we use to connect to DB. these may be dynamic bcoz it depends on environemnt like testing and prod.

=>There are several places to declare environment variables.
*we can declare it on the workflow level like (also we can declare them on job amd step level too)

name: workflow
on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - dev
      - main

env:
  MONGODB_DB_NAME: gha-demo  // this indicates that the mongodb name is available throught the workflow.

=>So this mongodb name will be available in all the jobs unless some job overrides it.


*We can declare it in the job level also.
=>we can get interpolate the variable with the $sign like.
${PATH}.

=>We can also get the values in this way with ${{env}} - using the env object in github which gives access to all the values in the environment variables.

Github Secrets
---------------
=>In the github secrets we should be able to store the confidential info inside the github secrets.
=>click the settings button --> Click on the secrets and variables --> we can click the Secrets button and then click on the actions.
=>After adding the values then we cannot view them but just add the values to it.


After adding the secrets now we can just reference them with {{secrets.}}
secrets - it is a variable which can be used to reference variables.


Environments
--------------

=>Github Environments are for workflows so they can reference these environments and provide extra configurations to the job.

In the environments we can add the environment specific secrets like the specific DB for testing, prod etc.

we can refere the environment by adding the environment inside the jobs like:

name: xyz
on: push

jobs:
  first_job:
    environment: testing // this is used to refer 
    env:
      MONGODB_CLUSTER_ADDRESS:  ----------
      .....
    
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      ............

while creating environments it will give freatures such as :
- Required reviewers - approval from specific reviewrs if necessary
- Wait timer: Wait for deployments to proceed.

Deployment branches:
- select the branches to which the event applies to.
