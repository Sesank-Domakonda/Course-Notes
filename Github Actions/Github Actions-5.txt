Why to use Custom Actions?

Eventhough there are tons of actions we want to build the custom actions because:

*simplify various steps in workflow 
ex:Instead of writing multiple step definitions you can build and use a single custom actions.

=> Multiple steps can be grouped into a single action.
ex: getting the code, cache it.

so we can create custom actions to group the commonly performed steps and make it into an actiona and reuse it.

*No existing(Community) Action:
=> This is when the public actions might not solve the specific problem you have in the workflow.
=> Custom actions can contain any logic you need to solve your specific workflow problems.
