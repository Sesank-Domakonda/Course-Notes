Controlling workflow and Job execution
---------------------------------------

=> We we able to write workflows from one point to another and if one job fails then the remaining execution stops.
but we sometimes we need conditional execution of jobs.


Conditional Jobs & Steps
------------------------

Jobs                                                                 Steps
- conditional execution with if field                              - Conditional execution via if field.
                                                                   - Continue-on-error field which allows to specify other steps execute even if one fails.


Special Conditional Functions
------------------------------

failure() - Returns true when any previous step/job failed.
success() - Returns true when none of the previous steps have failed.
always() -  Causes the step to always execute even when cancelled.
cancelled() - Returns true if the workflow has been cancelled.
