EC2 provides secured instances with key-pair.
It is a regional service.

EC2 provides the instance with security groups
---------------------------------------------

Security has Inbound rules and Outbound rules.


Inbound rules - who can access the ec2.
Outbound rules - what can ec2 access outside.


we have SSH :22
        RDP : 3389
        HTTP: 80
        HTTPS: 443
