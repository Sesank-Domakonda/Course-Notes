RDS  - Relational Database Service
====
For every application we need a DB instead of creating it locally we will do it in the cloud.

Every application will have 3 layers
*Front end (UI)
*Back End (business logic)
*Data base

Challenges with database setup
-----------------------------
1) Setup Machine to install DB server
2) Purchase DB server license
3) Install DB server in our  machine
4) Setup power for the machine
5) Setup a server room to keep our machine
6) Setup AC for room
7)Setup security for room
8) Setup DB backups

=> Using cloud the cloud provider will take care of all the works which are required for DB application.
=> In AWS we have RDS service to create and setup DB required fo application.
=> we just need to pay the money and use DB using AWS RDS service.

Steps to create MYSQL DB using RDS Service
------------------------------------------
Search for RDS ----> click on create DB ---> Select the required DB creation method(easy or standard) ---> Select the engine(MySQL, Aurora...) ---> DB INstance size(freetier/prod/dev) --->
Provide the db identifier, username and password\

once the DB is created it will generate an endpoint which can be used in our application.
uname: admin
pword: 321Kashes
port :3306
dbname: ihis

we have to provide DB properties to project team.

Steps to test MYSQL DB Setup
-----------------------------
=> To test the DB after it is created we can use MySQL workbench.


GUI Client                                              AWS Cloud    DB Endpoint URL, DB Username, DB port
(My SQL workbench)     -------------------------------      RDS
client s/w                                                MySQL DB
                                                              |
                                                              |
                                                              |
                                                            Java App


=> In the MySQL workbench we can provide the info
hostname - endpoint URL
Username: admin
password: 321Kashes 
andclick on test connection.
