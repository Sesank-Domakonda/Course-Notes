EC2 Instance types
===================
1) On Demand Instances 
2) Reserved Instances
3) Spot Instances
4) Dedicated Host


On-Demand Instance
===================
-> Fixed Price (Hourly) 
-> we will be charged for 1 hour even if we use for 5 minutes.
-> Pay for what you have used
-> No prior commitment or Prior payment.
-> No predictable usage.

Reserved Instances (Long Term Commitments)
==================
-> Long term payments
-> Prior Payment (Full, partial)
-> 1 or 3 years
-> 75% discount on hourly price.
-> Predictable usage

Spot Instances
==============
-> Auction instance
-> On Bidding basis ( Huge capacity for cheaper price)
-> Application with start and end times.

Dedicated Instances
====================
-> It refers to a physical server that is fully allocated to a single customer in a cloud environment.


Instance states
---------------
Launch
Running
Stop
Reboot 
Terminate

EC2 have several families
-------------------------
-> EC2 have several families like
General purpose - Balanced compute (memorym networking resources)
Compute Optmimized - High performace processors for compute-intensice applications. Suitable for batch processing, high-performance.
Memory Optmimized - Designed for workloads that pricess large data sets in memory. Ideal for high performance DB
Storage Optimized - High sequential read and write access to a very large data sets. Suitable for data warehousing, Hadoop.


AMI - Amazon Machine Image
====

What is an Image?
Entire copy of an OS is called an image.

AWS Image - Preconfigured system
-> we can create our own AMI in AWS.


Creating an Image ( Select the Instance - > Click on Actions -> Select Images and Templates -> Click on create Image)
=> we can now launch an instace from our AMI now. (go to images section and check the presence of image we have created.)
=> AMI is reion specific.

Delete the AMI ( select the AMI -> click on Actione -> Click on Deregister AMI)


EBS (Elastic Block store)
====  

=> When we create EC2 Instance with Linux OS we get storage upto 8 GB.
=> When we terminate the instance then we will loose our data too.
=> 30 GB is a free storage for EBS the rest be paid.


=> To store the data permanently even after the instance has been terminated we have elastic block storage.
=> In EBS we will create volumes to store the data. We can attach these volumes to EC2 Instances.

There are two types of  Storages
*EBS volumes
*Instance store

   EBS Volumes                                              Instance store
  =================================================================================
1) Permanent Storage                                        Not Persistent storage
2)No data loss even after EC2 is Stopped                    Not Persistent  
3)EBS Volume max size 16 TB                                 They get terminated after instance is terminated.



EBS Volume types (AZ specific)
-------------------
1)General purpose volumes(gp2, gp1) 1GB - 16TB
2)Provisioned IOPS Volumes (io1, io2) - SSD => High performance (4GB - 16 GB) - costly
3)Throughput (st1) - Frequently accessed data with cheap price.
4) Cold - HDD => Not feequently accessed data with cheap price
5) Magnetic - HDD => previous gen 

Creating Volumes - Click on volumes on the left hand side -> click on create volume -> Check options(volumetype & zone(make sure to use the same zone as the instance) ) -> Click on create volume
Attach volumes to Instance -> Select a particular volume -> Click on Actions -> Select the instance -> Click on attach


=> The EBS volumes are region specific. We can attach to the volumes specific to regions.

EBS Lab task
-------------
1) Create an EC2 Linux Instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI
2) Create additional ebs volume with 10 GB
3) Attach EBS volume of 10GB for storing data
4) Connect to EC2 instance and verify volumes (EBS volume should be shown)
5) Create a directory and mount EBS volume to created directory.
6) Store the data in EBS volume mounted directory (Create new files)
7) Detach EBS volume from EC2 and stop/terminate EC2 instance.
8) Create new EC2 instance and attach previously created EBS volume
9) Connect to new EC2 instance using putty and verify volumes (EBS volume should display)
10) Create a directory and mount EBS volume to created directory
11) Verify data which stored previously in EBS available or not (it should be present)
12) Stop instance and delete the volumes


procedure
----------
1) while creating an instance go to the storage and add volume  or create a volume and attac it seperately 
2) check with lsblk command
3) sudo file -s /dev/<path_to_ebs>  - It is used to determine the file system type or content of the specified device
4) sudo mke2fs -j /dev/xvdb - It formats the device at /dev/xvdb with an ext3 file system
5) sudo su
6) sudo mkdir  /newdisk - we are creating a new folder called newdisk
7) sudo mount /dev/xvdb /newdisk - we are mounting the EBS volume to the /newdisk
8) dh -h -we can check the disk storage and verify if the EBS is mounted to the directory.



Q) what does mount mean by?
We are pointing the EBS volume to the directory on the device. So whatever data we store on /newdisk will be stored on EBS volume.

Q) we already have EBS attached to our instance but why are we mouting EBS to a specific directory?
When you attach an EBS volume to an instance, it becomes available as a block device, but it is not automatically usable. 
You need to mount it to a directory in your file system to access and use the storage.
 
More on Root and EBS Volumes
-------------------------------
1) When we create EC2 instance, EBS Root Volume will be craeted by default.
2) We can detach EBS root volume from EC2
3) To run EC2 Instance EBS Root volume is mandatory.
4) Extra EBS volumes can be attched to an instance and remove when they are not required.
In real time root volume contains OS
=> Additional volumes contains our application and application configuration files.

Only Provisioned IOPS (io2) supports Multi Attach - volumes can be attached to multiple instances at a time.



EBS Snapshot
==============

Snapshot
----------
=> Its a copy/backup ,In AWS snapshots are used to take backup of volumes.
=> Every volume will have its own snapshot. ( Snapshots are taken for each EBS volume independently.)
=> It is 50 GB in size.
=> We will go for incremental backup (only latest changes are taken  but not taking snapshot  of entire file again and again). It is a point in time copy of the volume.

EBS Volumes --------> EBS Snapshot -------> EBS Volume
we can create snapshots from volumes and do the other way around.

=> we cannot attach snapshot to EC2 directly.
 From snapshot we will create volume and the volume can be attached to EC2.

=> Snapshots are regional specific. They can be copied from one region to the other in the same AWS account.
=> EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon EBS and AWS manages their storeage in S3.

How to move the volume from one AZ to other AZ?

Creating a Snapshot : Find the snapshots on the left ---> Select he resource type (single volume or multi volume)
------------------
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NOBnderhcDnOKYb2M4gtin6VU2i63CE6/view?usp=drive_link

Use volume option for taking a snapshot for a specific volume.
Instance option when the instance has multiple volumes attached.


Multiple volumes attached to EC2.                           Single volume to Multiple EC2 Instances.

V1  -------------------                                      EC2 (ia) -------------------
                      |                                                                    |
V2     ----------     EC2                                    EC2 (ib) ---------------- Volume
                       |                                                                   |
V3  ------------------                                       EC2 (ic) ----------------------
                                                               
                                                               But here the volume must be provisioned io2.



Creating a volume from Snapshot : Select the snapshots -----> click on actions ---> select the type of volume you want to create.
