Security Groups (SG)
-------------------

=> Security Groups are used to configure the inbound and outbound rules for the instance.




    inbound rules         EC2 Instance          outbound rules

Inbound rules: Decides who can access our EC2 instance.
outbound rules: What the EC2 instance can accrss.


 -> By default all inbound traffic is denied in EC2 and Outbound traffic is allowed.
 -> If we want to allow the traffic for EC2 then we have to configure inbound rules.
    SSH ----> Port Range(22)
    RDP ----> Port Range(3389)
    Http ---> Port Range(80)
    Https ---> Port Range

Creating Security Groups (EC2 ----> Under network and Security finf Security Groups ---> Click on Create Seciruty group --> Select the settings ---> Give the inbound and outbound details.)

Types of IP's in EC2 (Internet Protocol)
--------------------
1) private IP
2) public  IP
3) Elastic IP

Private IP
----------
=> Every EC2 instance will have its own IP called as private IP. We cannot connect to instances using the provate IP.
=> If we want to connect to EC2 instance from outside we need public IP.

note: private IP is mandatory for every EC2 instance. Public IP is optional.

=> Private IP is static and public IP is dynamic.

=> If we want one static IP to connect with our EC2 instance from outside then we should go for Elastic IP.
=> Elastic IPs are static IPs. If we start and stop teh instance Elastic Ip will not change.
=> 5 Elastic IPs are free of cost( soft limit).
=> If we crete Elastic IP then we should attach that with EC2 instance otherwise it will be charged. 

Elastic IP creation : EC2 -> IUnder network and Security find Elastic IPs  -> Click on Allocate Elastic IPs -> click on Allocate.
After creation select the Elastic IP -> Click on Actions ---> Select Associate Elastic IP address --> Choose the instance --> Click on associate buttons.
