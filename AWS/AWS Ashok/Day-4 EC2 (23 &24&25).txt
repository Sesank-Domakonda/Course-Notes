What is a webserver?
=> It is used to run web applications.
=> In EC2 Instance we will install web server to run web applications.

The process of taking code from devs and keeping it on webserver is called deployment.

Proces to Install a webserver into the instance
----------------------------------------------
1) Login into AWS
2)Create EC2 instance
3)Connect to EC2 Instance with putty
4)Install Webserver
5)Keep files in /var/www/html
6)Start the webserver
7)Configure security groups for ec2 instance.


Commands to install webserver 
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd

In the above activity we were able to put only one file in the webserver. So one project for one web server.

As a devops engineer we will perform deployment activity.

As people access the webserver then the load increases on the server. If the load increases server may crash.
=> To reduce the load we will use "Load Balancer"

Say we keep our applications in 2 servers.

AMI - Amazon Machine Image
--------------------------
=> It is a preconfigured system.

Linux machines will have a default ssh protocol with 22 port.
